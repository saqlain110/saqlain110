The WHITETAIL ALMANAC is a comprehensive calendar predicting daily feeding and travel patterns of the white-tailed deer. The listed information will indicate when a major feeding period should occur and where to hunt during that period. Green Days suggest stand placement along Travel Routes or the edge of a Food Supply. Days which are Red in color, suggest hunting in or around a whitetailâ€™s Resting Place.
